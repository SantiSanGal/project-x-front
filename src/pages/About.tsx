        <p className="mb-2">
          PixelsWar started as an idea to support my family and make our dreams come true—an idea that began 20 years ago.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2">
          PixelsWar is inspired by the iconic <span className="text-lime-600">Million Dollar Homepage</span> created by Alex Tew in 2005, a groundbreaking project that sold pixels as advertising space. At the time, I was only three years old and couldn't compete with him, but now, with modern technology, I’m bringing the concept back with a twist. My version enhances the idea with online payments, real-time interaction, and new dynamics.

        <p className="mb-2">
          My name is Santiago, I’m twenty-three years old, and my brother and I are the main providers for our family. We are a family of five. We used to live in a small house where all five of us shared the same room. Since I got a slightly more stable job, we’ve been able to move into a more comfortable house, but it’s still not ours. I've been working since I was 14 to help my parents and pay part of my school tuition.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          I've been trying to bring this project to life for a long time, but I couldn't because I lacked the necessary resources. I even took out a loan to buy a couple of laptops—one to sell and start a buying-and-selling business to manage some capital and another to work on this project. But they were stolen. One night, I invited a friend to my house so he could have a place to sleep because he had nowhere to go. He took them and disappeared. In the end, I tried to help someone in need, and now I am the one who needs help. So now, I’m here, working on this project in my free time after my regular job.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2">
          I'm doing this because I want to study. I dream of applying for a scholarship abroad, but I can't because I am the backbone of my family. They need me every day, and we rely on each other. I want to fulfill my mother’s dream of owning a house and taking her to visit Turkey. It hurt me deeply to hear her say the other day that she had given up and would never be able to go.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 font-semibold text-lime-600">
          I don’t seek fame, influence, or recognition. That’s why I won’t share my social media, even though I would like to. I just want my family and me to be happy.
        </p>

        <p className="text-white text-center mt-4 cursor-pointer">
          So, could you please help me?
